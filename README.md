Calculate the residuals of a set of points based on the formula e= y-Xw. Where y is a vector containing the y-coordinates of all points, X is a matrix containing the x-coordinates of points and a column of units for multiplication by m, w is a vector of the coefficients of the line.
Then we calculate the loss function, that is, L1 and L2 are also known as MAE and MSE :D
